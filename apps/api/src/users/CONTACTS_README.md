# Contact Management System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of the Contact Management System for the Telegram-like web chat application. The system provides comprehensive functionality for managing user contacts, blocking users, and reporting abuse.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Contact Request System
- **Send Contact Requests**: Users can send contact requests by username with optional messages
- **Accept/Decline Requests**: Recipients can accept or decline pending contact requests
- **Auto-Accept Logic**: If both users send requests to each other, they are automatically accepted
- **Privacy Controls**: Users can disable contact requests in their privacy settings
- **Blocking Prevention**: Cannot send requests to blocked users

### 2. Contact Management
- **Contact Lists**: Retrieve paginated lists of accepted contacts
- **Contact Removal**: Remove existing contact relationships
- **Contact Status Checking**: Check if two users are contacts
- **Privacy-Aware Display**: Respects user privacy settings for last seen and online status

### 3. User Blocking System
- **Block by ID or Username**: Block users using either their user ID or username
- **Automatic Contact Removal**: Blocking a user removes any existing contact relationship
- **Unblock Functionality**: Unblock previously blocked users
- **Blocked Users List**: Retrieve paginated lists of blocked users
- **Bidirectional Blocking Check**: Check if users are blocked in either direction

### 4. User Reporting System
- **Report Users**: Report users for inappropriate behavior with reason and description
- **Report by ID or Username**: Support both user ID and username-based reporting
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate reports within 24 hours
- **Admin Review**: Reports are created with PENDING status for admin review

## API Endpoints

### Contact Requests
- `POST /users/contacts/requests` - Send a contact request
- `PUT /users/contacts/requests/:requestId` - Respond to a contact request
- `GET /users/contacts/requests/pending` - Get pending contact requests (received)
- `GET /users/contacts/requests/sent` - Get sent contact requests

### Contact Management
- `GET /users/contacts` - Get contacts list with pagination
- `DELETE /users/contacts/:contactId` - Remove a contact
- `GET /users/contacts/check/:userId` - Check if users are contacts

### User Blocking
- `POST /users/blocked` - Block a user by ID
- `POST /users/blocked/username` - Block a user by username
- `DELETE /users/blocked/:userId` - Unblock a user
- `GET /users/blocked` - Get blocked users list with pagination

### User Reporting
- `POST /users/reports` - Report a user by ID
- `POST /users/reports/username` - Report a user by username

## Database Schema

The implementation uses the following database models:

### ContactRequest
- Tracks contact request relationships between users
- Supports PENDING, ACCEPTED, DECLINED, and BLOCKED statuses
- Includes optional message field
- Unique constraint on sender-receiver pairs

### BlockedUser
- Tracks user blocking relationships
- Includes optional reason field
- Unique constraint on blocking-blocked user pairs
- Automatically removes contact relationships when created

### UserReport
- Tracks user reports for abuse handling
- Includes reason, description, and status fields
- Links to both reporter and reported users
- Supports admin review workflow

## Service Architecture

### ContactsService
The main service class that handles all contact management operations:

- **Contact Requests**: `sendContactRequest()`, `respondToContactRequest()`, `getPendingContactRequests()`, `getSentContactRequests()`
- **Contact Management**: `getContacts()`, `removeContact()`, `areUsersContacts()`
- **User Blocking**: `blockUser()`, `blockUserByUsername()`, `unblockUser()`, `getBlockedUsers()`, `areUsersBlocked()`
- **User Reporting**: `reportUser()`, `reportUserByUsername()`

### Key Features
- **Privacy Enforcement**: Respects user privacy settings for contact requests and visibility
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and business rule enforcement
- **Error Handling**: Proper error responses for various edge cases
- **Performance**: Optimized database queries with proper indexing

## Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

### Contact Request DTOs
- `SendContactRequestDto` - For sending contact requests
- `RespondToContactRequestDto` - For accepting/declining requests
- `ContactRequestResponse` - Response format for contact requests
- `ContactListResponse` - Paginated contact list response
- `ContactResponse` - Individual contact information

### Blocking DTOs
- `BlockUserDto` - For blocking users by ID
- `BlockUserByUsernameDto` - For blocking users by username
- `UnblockUserDto` - For unblocking users
- `BlockedUserResponse` - Response format for blocked users
- `BlockedUsersListResponse` - Paginated blocked users list

### Reporting DTOs
- `ReportUserDto` - For reporting users by ID
- `ReportUserByUsernameDto` - For reporting users by username
- `UserReportResponse` - Response format for user reports

## Security Features

### Input Validation
- All inputs are validated using class-validator decorators
- UUID validation for user IDs
- String length limits for messages and descriptions
- Enum validation for status fields

### Business Rules Enforcement
- Cannot send contact requests to self
- Cannot block or report self
- Respects privacy settings for contact requests
- Prevents duplicate reports within 24 hours
- Automatic contact removal when blocking

### Privacy Controls
- Users can disable contact requests
- Last seen visibility controlled by privacy settings
- Online status visibility controlled by privacy settings
- Contact-only visibility options supported

## Testing

### Verification Script
A comprehensive verification script (`verify-contacts-implementation.ts`) tests all functionality:
- Contact request workflows (send, accept, decline)
- Contact management (list, remove, check status)
- User blocking (block, unblock, list blocked users)
- User reporting (report users, prevent duplicates)
- Error handling (invalid inputs, business rule violations)

### Test Results
All tests pass successfully, confirming:
- ✅ Contact request system works correctly
- ✅ Contact management functions properly
- ✅ User blocking system operates as expected
- ✅ User reporting system functions correctly
- ✅ Privacy settings are respected
- ✅ Error cases are handled appropriately

## Requirements Coverage

This implementation satisfies all requirements from the specification:

### Requirement 5.1: Contact Request System
✅ Implemented username-based contact request sending and response system

### Requirement 5.2: Contact Blocking and Unblocking
✅ Implemented comprehensive user blocking system with automatic contact removal

### Requirement 5.3: Contact Search and Discovery
✅ Implemented username-based user discovery and contact status checking

### Requirement 5.4: Contact Status Tracking
✅ Implemented contact relationship tracking and management

### Requirement 11.1: User Reporting System
✅ Implemented user reporting system for abuse handling with admin review workflow

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Unique constraints to prevent duplicate relationships
- Efficient pagination using cursor-based approaches
- Optimized queries with selective field loading

### Caching Strategy
- Privacy settings cached to reduce database queries
- Contact status checks optimized for frequent access
- Paginated results support efficient loading

### Scalability
- Stateless service design for horizontal scaling
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Minimal data transfer with selective field loading

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Real-time notifications for contact requests
- Bulk contact operations
- Contact import/export functionality
- Advanced reporting categories
- Contact groups/labels
- Contact synchronization across devices

### Integration Points
- WebSocket notifications for real-time updates
- Push notification service integration
- Admin dashboard for report management
- Analytics and monitoring integration

## Conclusion

The Contact Management System has been successfully implemented with comprehensive functionality covering all specified requirements. The system provides a robust foundation for user relationship management in the chat application, with proper security, privacy controls, and performance optimizations.

All core functionality has been tested and verified to work correctly, providing a solid base for the next phases of development.
